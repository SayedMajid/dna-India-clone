        The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the Telecom department`s
        proposal to conduct a spectrum auction through which spectrum will be
        assigned to the successful bidders for providing 5G services to public
        and enterprises.

      <Text fontSize="20px">
        A total of 72097.85 MHz of spectrum with a validity period of 20 years
        will be put to auction to be held by the end of July, 2022. The auction
        will be held for spectrum in various Low (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 900
        MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz, 2300 MHz), Mid (3300 MHz) and High (26 GHz)
        frequency bands.

      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        It is expected that the Mid and High band spectrum will be utilised by
        Telecom Service Providers to roll-out of 5G technology-based services
        capable of providing speed and capacities which would be about 10 times
        higher than what is possible through the current 4G services.
      </Text>
      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        The Cabinet announced various progressive options with regard to the
        spectrum to be acquired by bidders through the forthcoming spectrum
        auction for facilitating ease of doing business.

      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        For the first time ever, there is no mandatory requirement to make
        upfront payment by the successful bidders. Payments for spectrum can be
        made in 20 equal annual installments to be paid in advance at the
        beginning of each year.
      </Text>
      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        This is expected to significantly ease cash flow requirements and lower
        the cost of doing business in this sector. The bidders would be given an
        option to surrender the spectrum after 10 years with no future
        liabilities with respect to balance installments
      </Text>
      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        The spectrum auction will be benefitted by the Telecom Sector Reforms
        announced in September, 2021. The reforms include zero Spectrum Usage
        Charges (SUC) on the spectrum acquired in the upcoming auction,
        providing a significant relief to the service providers in terms of the
        operating cost of telecom networks. Further, the requirement of
        submitting a financial bank guarantee equivalent to one annual
        installment has also been done away with.

        The government said that the 4G ecosystem created in the country is now
        leading to 5G indigenous development. The 5G test bed setup in eight top
        technology institutes of India is speeding up the launch of domestic 5G
        technology in India.

        Spectrum is an integral and necessary part of the entire 5G ecosystem.
        The upcoming 5G services have the potential to create new age
        businesses, generate additional revenue for enterprises and provide
        employment arising from the deployment of innovative use-cases and
        technologies.

        The availability of sufficient backhaul spectrum is also necessary to
        enable the roll-out of 5G services. To meet the backhaul demand, the
        Cabinet has decided to provisionally allot two carriers of 250 MHz each
        in E-band to the Telecom Service Providers.
      </Text>
      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        The Cabinet also decided to double the number of traditional Microwave
        backhaul carriers in the existing frequency bands of 13, 15, 18 and 21
        GHz bands.

      <br/>
      <Text fontSize="20px">
        The Cabinet also decided to enable the development and setting up of
        Private Captive Networks to spur a new wave of innovations in Industry
        4.0 applications such as machine to machine communications, Internet of
        Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) across automotive,
        healthcare, agriculture, energy, and other sectors.

        The government noted that Broadband, especially mobile broadband, has
        become an integral part of the daily lives of the citizens. This
        received a big boost through the rapid expansion of 4G services across
        the country since 2015.
